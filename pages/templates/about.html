  <h1>About Cardiovascular Illness Prediction</h1>
  <p>Our predictive model assesses the risk of cardiovascular illness based on several key factors:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Age in years:</strong> The age of the individual is a significant predictor of cardiovascular risk. As age increases, the risk of developing cardiovascular illness also tends to increase.</li>
    <li><strong>Height in centimeters:</strong> Height is considered as one of the parameters for assessing cardiovascular risk, as it can influence factors such as body mass index (BMI).</li>
    <li><strong>Weight in kilograms:</strong> Weight is another important factor in assessing cardiovascular risk. Higher body weight, especially when combined with other risk factors, can increase the likelihood of developing cardiovascular illness.</li>
    <li><strong>Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg):</strong> Blood pressure readings are crucial indicators of cardiovascular health. Elevated blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular illness.</li>
    <li><strong>Smoking status:</strong> Smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Individuals who smoke are at a significantly higher risk of developing cardiovascular illness compared to non-smokers.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical activity level:</strong> Regular physical activity is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Being active for at least one hour per day can contribute to overall cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of illness.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By considering these factors, our model provides predictions on the likelihood of an individual developing cardiovascular illness, helping users make informed decisions about their health.</p>
